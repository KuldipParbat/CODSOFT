# Codsoft Internship Projects
Welcome to the repository for my projects completed during the Codsoft Internship! This repository showcases three applications I developed using Java and Java Swing. Each project highlights different aspects of software development, from user interface design to database integration and logic implementation.

## üöÄ Projects Overview
### 1. Guess Number Game
A simple yet engaging game where the player has to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range.

### Features:

User-friendly interface built with Java Swing.
<br>Random number generation.
<br>Feedback on guesses (too high, too low, or correct).
<br>Retry option for continuous guessing.
### How to Run:

bash
<br>Copy code
<br>cd NumberGuess
<br>javac NumberGuess.java
<br>java NumberGuess
### 2. ATM Simulation Application
A simulation of an ATM system that includes essential functionalities like balance checking, withdrawals, deposits, transaction history, and PIN changes, all integrated with a MySQL database.

### Features:

Balance check, cash withdrawal, and deposit functionality.
<br>Transaction history (mini statement).
<br>Secure PIN change option.
<br>MySQL database integration for data persistence.
### How to Run:

bash
<br>Copy code
<br>cd atm-simulation
<br>javac ATMApplication.java
<br>java ATMApplication
<br>Note: Make sure to set up the MySQL database as instructed in the ATM project's section.

### 3. Quiz Application
A timed quiz application that allows users to select from multiple subjects (Java, Python, C, MySQL) and answer 10 multiple-choice questions within 2 minutes.

### Features:

Subject selection: Java, Python, C, MySQL.
<br>10 multiple-choice questions per quiz.
<br>2-minute timer for added challenge.
<br>Immediate feedback and scoring.
### How to Run:

bash
<br>Copy code
<br>cd quiz-application
<br>javac QuizApplication.java
<br>java QuizApplication
## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions
### Clone the Repository:

bash
<br>Copy code
<br>git clone https://github.com/KuldipParbat/CODSOFT/
<br>cd codsoft-internship-projects
### Run Individual Projects:

Navigate to the corresponding project folder and follow the How to Run instructions provided for each project.
#### MySQL Database Setup (for ATM Simulation Application):

Import the provided database.sql file to set up the necessary tables.
<br>Update the database connection settings in the Java code to match your MySQL configuration.
## üìö Learning Outcomes
During the Codsoft Internship, I gained hands-on experience in:

<br>Java Programming: Enhanced my skills in Java, focusing on logic implementation and object-oriented design.
<br>GUI Development with Java Swing: Learned how to create user-friendly interfaces that are both functional and visually appealing.
<br>Database Integration: Successfully integrated a MySQL database with a Java application, handling data persistence and retrieval.
<br>Problem-Solving: Developed solutions to simulate real-world applications like ATM systems and quiz platforms.
## üë®‚Äçüíª Technologies Used
